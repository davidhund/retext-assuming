# retext-assuming

[![XO code style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-XO-5ed9c7.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/xo)


Check for unhelpful ‘assuming’ phrases such as 'just', 'simply' or 'obviously' with [**retext**][retext].

Using these phrases in documentation is unhelpful: “simple” is relative to a users’ knowledge and experience. Often it is fine to leave the phrase out completely:

Avoid:
> “Simply run the tests. Just type `npm test`…”

But use:

> “To run the tests type `npm test`…”


## Installation

Install through [npm][]:

```bash
npm install retext-assuming
```

## Usage

Say we have the following file, `example.txt`:

```text
You can just import an ES6 module.
Everything is simply Javascript.
Obviously you would need NodeJS > 8.
Actually, it's quite easy to use.
```

And our script, `example.js`, looks as follows:

```javascript
var vfile = require('to-vfile');
var report = require('vfile-reporter');
var retext = require('retext');
var dontAssume = require('retext-assuming');

retext()
  .use(dontAssume)
  .process(vfile.readSync('example.txt'), function (err, file) {
    console.error(report(err || file));
  });
```

Should result in:

```text
example.txt

  2:15-2:21  warning  Avoid “simply”, it's not helpful     no-simply     retext-assuming
